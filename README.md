# Exoplanet-Detector

Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network used to classify exoplanets using the transit method.

CRNN achieves a 99% classification accuracy and has a classification loss of 0.04 on the dataset.
The data is taken from NASA's Kepler Mission Campaign 3. To increase the size of the dataset and balance it, SMOTE (synthetic minority over-sampling technique) was used.
